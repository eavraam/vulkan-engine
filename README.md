README.md is under construction, but just to keep track of the completed tasks so far:

0. Project Setup

- Building Project
- Code Walkthrough

==> Dependencies and Project is set up.

1. Initializing Vulkan

- Vulkan Initialization
- Vulkan Initialization Code
- Executing Vulkan Commands
- Setting up Vulkan Commands
- Rendering Loop
- Mainloop Code

==> Setting the main initialization code, ends with a flashing blue screen (something is rendered, hooray).

2. Drawing with Compute

- Improving the render loop
- Vulkan Shaders (theory session)
- Vulkan Shaders
- ImGui
- Push Constants

==> Compute shaders and ImGui are up and running.

3. Graphics Pipelines

- The Graphics Pipiline
- Setting up render pipeline
- Mesh buffers
- Mesh loading
- Blending
- Window resizing

==> Render pipeline is set, I can render a Suzanne's (monkey) head with alpha blending (or not). Window can also be resized now without crashing.

4. Textures and Engine Architecture

- Descriptor Abstractions
-
